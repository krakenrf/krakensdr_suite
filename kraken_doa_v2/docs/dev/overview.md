# Overview: build, architecture, threads, components

Moved verbatim from `kraken_doa_v2/CLAUDE.md` on 2026-10-24 (that file now keeps
only what every kraken_doa session needs, plus an index of these files). Not
loaded automatically. *Italic* topic names refer to the other files in this
folder (index: `README.md` here, or the table in `kraken_doa_v2/CLAUDE.md`);
"above" / "below" meant elsewhere in the old file.

## Project Context

This directory contains the **Heimdall DoA Client** - an FFT viewer and MUSIC Direction of Arrival processor for RTL-SDR systems. This client connects to the Heimdall Server (in `../heimdall_v2/`) to receive multi-channel IQ data and performs real-time signal processing.

Suite-wide rules are in `../CLAUDE.md`; the long-form overview of the whole system (server + client) is `../docs/dev/suite-reference.md`.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Quick start
make              # Build (auto-installs uWebSockets)
make run          # Build and run client
make deps         # Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)

# Build management
make clean        # Remove build artifacts
make rebuild      # Clean and rebuild
make distclean    # Remove everything including uWebSockets
make status       # Check dependencies and build status

# Debugging and profiling
make debug        # Build with debug symbols
make debug-arm    # ARM build with NEON debug output
```

# Important Build Note

DO NOT use all 4 cores when building with -j4 or nproc. Use 3 cores MAXIMUM. Otherwise the system will crash due to all cores being in use.

**ARM Detection:** The Makefile automatically detects ARM architecture (aarch64, armv7l) and enables NEON optimizations w
ith `-march=native -mtune=native`.

### Threading Model

**Worker Threads:**
- `data_receiver_thread`: TCP client → IQ conversion → raw buffer
- `decimation_processor_thread`: Decimation processing for all channels
- `fft_processor_thread_per_channel` × 8: One FFT worker per channel (true parallelism)
- `fm_processor_thread`: FM demodulation and audio streaming
- `doa_processor_thread`: MUSIC algorithm execution
- `web_server_main`: uWebSockets event loop (HTTP/WebSocket)
- Status monitoring thread: Periodic statistics printing

**Control commands run on ONE thread - the uWS loop:** every
`ControlHandler::handle_websocket_message()` call (browser messages, the
persisted-settings replay, web-mapper cloud settings) is dispatched on the
uWebSockets loop thread. The replay is deferred there by the data receiver on
its first heimdall connection (`loop->defer`); replaying from the receiver
thread raced browser commands (a change mid-replay could be overwritten or go
unsaved). From any other thread, use `loop->defer` - never call the dispatcher
directly.

**Thread Count:**
- Base workers: 8 threads
- Per-channel FFT: 8 threads (one per channel)
- VFO pipelines (data_receiver.cpp): first every VFO's decimation in ONE pass
  (`SharedDecimator::decimateVfos`, below), then per VFO its MUSIC / squelch /
  talker DoA - with 2+ VFOs the first on the receiver thread and the rest on
  a persistent 3-thread pool (`std::async` used to create an OS thread per
  VFO per packet); FM only and independent / wideband mode (one channel per
  VFO, no MUSIC) all inline
- Decimation: ONE pool shared by every VFO (cores + 1 threads: 5 on the Pi 5;
  `decimation_pool()` in shared_decimator.cpp - each VFO had its own pool of
  MAX_CHANNELS 8 threads until 2026-10-22): a task per input array (an
  antenna, every VFO on it; a tuner in independent mode), the first on the
  calling thread
- **Total (Pi 5, measured 2026-10-22): ~29 threads with one VFO, ~32 with
  three** (51 with three before the shared pool)

### Key Components

**Signal Processing** (`src/signal_processing/`):
- `fft_processor.cpp`: Spectrum calculation (pffft via plugins/sdk/kraken_fft.hpp)
- `fm_demodulator.cpp`: Phase-based FM demod with hardware atan2f
- `music_processor.cpp`: Eigenvalue-based direction finding
- `shared_decimator.cpp`: Thread-local decimators with coefficient caching

**Networking** (`src/networking/`):
- `tcp_client.cpp`: Connects to Heimdall server (ports 8091, 8092)
- `websocket_server.cpp`: Browser UI communication (port 8080, HTTPS).
  `idleTimeout = 30`: a client silent for 30 s is pinged and closed if it
  doesn't pong (browsers pong automatically), so a phone that drops off Wi-Fi
  is gone in ~30 s instead of lingering until TCP gives up (~15 min)
- `data_receiver.cpp`: Packet reception, IQ conversion, decimation coordination
- `binary_message.cpp`: Wire protocol encoding/decoding

**Utilities** (`src/utils/`):
- `iq_converter.cpp`: Optimized uint8→float conversion (compiler auto-vectorization)
- `raw_data_buffer.cpp`: Bounded queue with automatic old data cleanup
- `ring_buffer.cpp`: Lock-free circular buffers for FFT/audio
- `system_stats.cpp`: CPU/memory usage tracking
- `thread_pool.hpp`: Generic thread pool (SharedDecimator's shared
  decimation pool, the pipeline's VFO pool)
- `include/utils/json_escape.hpp`: `json_escape()` for every hand-built JSON
  emitter, and `json_find()` - the one flat-object reader (settings file,
  web-mapper cloud messages) - which decodes every JSON escape including
  `\uXXXX` (to UTF-8, surrogate pairs too), so values round-trip. It matches
  only KEYS of the top-level object (a string value equal to the key name,
  key text inside another string, or a nested object's key is skipped)

**Managers** (`src/`):
- `channel_manager.cpp`: Channel state (frequency, gain, tuner mappings)
- `decimator_manager.cpp`: Dynamic decimator allocation (FM + MUSIC)
- `control_handler.cpp`: WebSocket command processing
- `message_builders.cpp`: JSON/binary message construction
