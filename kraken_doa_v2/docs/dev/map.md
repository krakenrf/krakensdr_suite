# Map (right-hand pane) and decoder map points

Moved verbatim from `kraken_doa_v2/CLAUDE.md` on 2026-10-24 (that file now keeps
only what every kraken_doa session needs, plus an index of these files). Not
loaded automatically. *Italic* topic names refer to the other files in this
folder (index: `README.md` here, or the table in `kraken_doa_v2/CLAUDE.md`);
"above" / "below" meant elsewhere in the old file.

**🗺 Map (right-hand pane) + decoder map points:**
- Plugins report positions with `host.map_point(kp::MapPoint)` / `map_remove`
  (kraken_plugin.hpp; `kp::Info::map = true` makes the decoder tab offer
  "🗺 Plot on map" - also shown once a decoder has points; off until the
  user ticks it). Stored per decoder in its `Report` (above), sent only
  while ticked. Reporting today: adsb (aircraft), aprs (stations / objects /
  items, marker from the APRS symbol, course / speed from `ccc/sss`, killed
  objects removed, ttl 1 h), dmr (GPS info LC -> the talking radio: id =
  radio ID from the slot's voice LC, label = talker alias), dstar (GPS
  slow data: NMEA RMC / GGA with a valid checksum, DPRS with a valid
  CRC-16/X.25 -> the MY callsign / DPRS callsign). The lib decoders use
  `dig::Report::map()` / `station()` (dig_common.hpp)
- `MessageBuilders::build_map_message()`, 1 Hz on TOPIC_CTL (websocket_server
  map_timer, sent even when empty - it carries the station):
  `{"map":{"full":bool,"station":[lat,lon]|null,"pts":[{v,p,i,la,lo,l,k,h,
  a,s,x,age,ttl}],"keys":["vfo|plugin|id",...]}}` - pts = the points
  updated since the previous push (per-VFO map seq, like the digital
  events), keys = every live point of every decoder that is on with
  "Plot on map" on: pages drop markers whose key is missing (removal,
  expiry, Plot on map off, decoder off). `request_map_full()` (GET_MAP from
  a page opening the map, DIGITAL_OPT map) makes the next push carry all
- UI (kraken_doa.html, "🗺 MAP" block; state `mapState` etc. in the globals
  block because `applyOpModeUI` -> `rpApply` can run before that block is
  evaluated): own canvas slippy map, NO map library - the page must work
  without internet (uPlot is inlined for the same reason). Web Mercator,
  fractional zoom (tiles of the nearest integer zoom scaled) MAP_MIN_Z 2 -
  MAP_MAX_Z 22: past a layer's deepest tiles (`max` 19) those are scaled up
  (z22 ~3 cm/px, 8x); range rings down to 5 m, graticule to 0.00001 deg
  (decimals from the step), drag / wheel
  / pinch / double-click, 🔍 (search - *🔍 Map search* below) +/− 🏠
  (station, was ⌖) 🎯 (the estimated transmitter) ⤢ (fit all), Street (OSM
  tile.openstreetmap.org) / Satellite (Esri World_Imagery + the
  World_Boundaries_and_Places label layer), attribution shown. Tiles: cache
  of 400 (LRU), a failed tile retried after 15 s doubling to 5 min, a missing
  tile drawn from a loaded lower-zoom tile; underneath always a lat/lon
  graticule, so with no internet the markers sit on a plain grid + an
  "offline" notice (tile errors in the last minute and no tile loaded for
  30 s). Station = yellow mast + range rings (step to suit the zoom; the
  mast can be selected and dragged - *📡 Station on the map*).
  Markers by `kind` (aircraft rotated by heading, vehicle, ship, station,
  person, point) in the VFO's colour, label + altitude, greyed after 30 s
  without an update; trails (client-side, last 15 min / 400 points);
  click = popup (the plugin's "key: value" info lines + position, distance
  / bearing from the station, age); status line = counts per VFO decoder
- Right-hand pane: `.doa-panel#right-pane` holds the DoA displays and
  `#map-pane`. `mapToggle()` (🗺 Map button under the waterfall, ✕, the
  decoder tab's "Show map") / `rpShow('doa'|'map')` (header tabs, coherent
  only) -> `rpApply()`: body classes `map-on` (pane shown in every mode)
  and `rp-map` (map tab visible - always outside coherent); width
  `--map-w` (42% default, `#rp-resizer` drag on its left edge, double-click
  = default). The calibration greying applies to `.doa-content` only.
  localStorage `kraken_map` {on, tab, w, layer, z, mx, my, trails}; first
  open centres on the station (else the world) and fits the first markers
- Tests: scratchpad mock-server test t_map (offline tiles forced by
  pointing the layers at a closed port) and an end-to-end run of the real
  kraken_doa (from a scratch dir - its own doa_settings.json) fed by a fake
  heimdall streaming a synthetic 1090 MHz recording
